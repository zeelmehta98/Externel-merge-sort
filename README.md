# Externel-merge-sort
External Merge sort is an algorithm that is used to sort data that does not fit in main memory(RAM) and instead, it must reside in the slower external memory.
This code is completely written in python.

Note:

    1. Please modify the value of "path_of_folder" variable to the folder where code output is expected.
  
    2. To change number of records in database change value of global variable "dataset_size". 
	
    3. After runs are created, the code overwrites these files by sorted values (during ExternalSorting() funtion). 

    4. All .txt files are deleted from execution folder when code runs initially everytime.

    5. Final output of the code will be stored in ExternallySortedDataset.txt file.
